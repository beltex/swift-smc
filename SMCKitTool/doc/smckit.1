.SH "DESCRIPTION"
An OS X command line tool for interfacing with the Apple System Management Controller (SMC) in Swift on Intel based Macs\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
List of supported command line options (flags/switchs):
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-color\fR
Colorize output where applicable\.
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-show\-keys\fR
Show SMC keys (FourCC) when printing temperature sensors\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fan\fR
Show the machines fan speeds\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show the list of options\.
.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-check\-key\fR \fIvalue\fR
Check if a FourCC is a valid SMC key on this machine\.
.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-misc\fR
Show misc information about this machine\.
.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-fan\-id\fR \fIvalue\fR
The id (number \- starts from 0) of the fan whose speed to set\. The list of id\'s can be seen via the \fB\-\-fan\fR option\. Must be used in combination \fB\-\-fan\-speed\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-power\fR
Show power related information about this machine\.
.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-fan\-speed\fR \fIvalue\fR
The minimum speed (RPM \- revolutions per minute) of the fan to set\. By minimum we mean that OS X can interject and raise the fan speed if needed, however it will not go below this\. Must be used with \fB\-\-fan\-id\fR\. Requires root privileges\.
.
.IP
\fBWARNING\fR: You are playing with hardware here, \fBBE CAREFUL\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-temperature\fR
Show the list of temperature sensors on this machine\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show smckit version\.
.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warn\fR
Show warning levels for temperature sensors and fan speeds\.
.
.SH "DETAIL"
.
.TP
\fBFan\fR
All Intel based Macs to this point have at least one fan, with the exception of the newly added fanless MacBook (8,1)\.
.
.TP
\fBTemperature\fR
The list of temperature sensors may not be exhaustive\. In addition, the maximum temperature of each individual sensor is not known\. Thus, a global max of 128 degrees is used\. Finally, the names of the sensors may not be mapped to the correct hardware component\. This is all due to the fact that the SMC has a closed source driver, and thus information about it\'s inner workings is limited\.
.
.IP
If a sensor has a value that is constant and completely disproportionate to the rest, then there is a chance that it is faulty\. This could be due to bad or damaged hardware (liquid on the logic board), or a bug in the SMC driver itself\. Run the \fIApple Hardware Test\fR diagnostics suite in such a case to confirm\. Example: \fIhttps://github\.com/beltex/SMCKit/issues/15\fR
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Due to Swift, smckit requires OS X 10\.9 (Mavericks) and above\. This implies an Intel based 64\-bit machine\.
